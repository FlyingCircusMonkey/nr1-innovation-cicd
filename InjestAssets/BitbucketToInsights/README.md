# Bitbucket To Insights

The Github to Insights Integration is a Node.JS service hosted on Heroku. The service endpoint expects a POST message from Bitbucket's Webhook, parses the data and sends it to Insights.

More information on Bitbucket's Webhook settings can be found here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html
